# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Use the file-defined 62 v1 requirement IDs as authoritative, despite the prompt referencing 57.
- [Roadmap]: Keep real-money execution, private keys, signers, order placement, funding, and live funded-wallet validation out of v1.
- [Roadmap]: Front-load executable scaffold, factory portability, safety, configuration, schema, idempotency, and validation ownership before provider workers.
- [Roadmap]: Build scanner -> tracker -> simulator -> Pyth -> API/dashboard so each phase consumes durable outputs from prior phases.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Repository currently has no `src/`, `tests/`, `pyproject.toml`, or lockfile.
- [Phase 1]: `.factory` commands currently assume an absolute organized checkout path instead of the active workspace.
- [Phase 2]: Environment contracts are split across `.env.example`, `.factory/library/environment.md`, `.factory/services.yaml`, and validation docs.
- [Phase 3+]: Live Polymarket and Pyth payload details need sanitized fixture capture before provider adapter behavior can be trusted.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Execution | Real-money order placement, signers, funding, private keys, relayers, bridge/deposit/withdraw, and zero-slot/Solana/Jito execution paths | v2+ only after separate approval and security design | v1 roadmap |
| Product | Public web frontend, mobile app, multi-user auth/SaaS, production deployment | v2+ | v1 roadmap |
| Analytics | Historical replay/backtesting, market settlement lifecycle, wallet clustering/sybil detection, AI commentary | v2+ | v1 roadmap |
